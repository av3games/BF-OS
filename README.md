# BF-OS
Its an OS (or rather a GUI) running in 100% BF.  
It's open Source (lol) and I will relased the BF and S-Code files here...

## Other
Don't wonder why the Code in BFOSv1 is so bad...  
It's just me writing a GUI with Tic Tac Toe in S-CODE for the first time and the code is pretty big...  
I will probably optimise the code later on (and maybe rewrite tic tac toe or "import" one that Mitxela made)
